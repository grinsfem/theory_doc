We will generally be discussing weak formulation of PDEs on open
connected subsets of $\mathbb{R}^n$, $n$ = 1, 2, or 3, denoted
$\Omega$. We denote the boundary of $\Omega$ as $\Gamma$. $\Gamma$ can
be partitioned in many ways, but typically we consider $\Gamma_D$, the
part of $\Gamma$ where Dirichlet boundary conditions are imposed and
$\Gamma_N$ where Neumann conditions are applied. For systems with
multiple unknown variables, we can partition the boundary $\Gamma$
differently for each variable. We'll append the variable name to the
subscript, e.g. the Neumann part of the boundary for the velocity
variable $\bu$ will be denoted at $\Gamma_{N,\bu}$.

We use typical inner product notation for integrals over $\Omega$:
%
\begin{equation}
\left( \bu, \bv \right) := \int_{\Omega} \bu \cdot \bv \; d\bx
\end{equation}
